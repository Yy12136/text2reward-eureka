            Generate a general reward function for robotic manipulation:
            Pick up cube A and lift it up by 0.2 meter.
            
            The reward function should:
            1. Be sparse but meaningful
            2. Focus on task completion
            3. Be applicable to similar tasks
            
            Use the same variables as before.
            Return the reward function code only.
