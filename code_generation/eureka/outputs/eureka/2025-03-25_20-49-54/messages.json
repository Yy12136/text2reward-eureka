As an example,\nthe reward function signature can be: @torch.jit.script\ndef compute_reward(object_pos: torch.Tensor, goal_pos: torch.Tensor) -> Tuple[torch.Tensor, Dict[str, torch.Tensor]]:\n    ...\n    return reward, {}\n\nSince the reward function will be decorated with @torch.jit.script,\nplease make sure that the code is compatible with TorchScript (e.g., use torch tensor instead of numpy array). \nMake sure any new tensor or variable you introduce is on the same device as the input tensors. The output of the reward function should consist of two items:\n    (1) the total reward,\n    (2) a dictionary of each individual reward component.\nThe code output should be formatted as a python code string: \"```python ... ```\".\n\nSome helpful tips for writing the reward function code:\n    (1) You may find it helpful to normalize the reward to a fixed range by applying transformations like torch.exp to the overall reward or its components\n    (2) If you choose to transform a reward component, then you must also introduce a temperature parameter inside the transformation function; this parameter must be a named variable in the reward function and it must not be an input variable. Each transformed reward component should have its own temperature variable\n    (3) Make sure the type of each input variable is correctly specified; a float input variable should not be specified as torch.Tensor\n    (4) Most importantly, the reward code's input variables must contain only attributes of the provided environment class definition (namely, variables that have prefix self.). Under no circumstance can you introduce new input variables.\n"

        "content": "Based on the policy feedback, here's my analysis and an improved reward function:\n\nAnalysis:\n1. angle_reward: \n   - Quickly reaches near-perfect scores (mean 0.99, max 1.00)\n   - Temperature might be too lenient (0.2)\n   - Can be made more sensitive to small angle deviations\n\n2. position_reward: \n   - Shows good variation (mean 0.95, min 0.51)\n   - Could benefit from slightly higher sensitivity\n\n3. velocity_penalty:\n   - Shows wide variation (mean 0.92, min 0.00)\n   - Current temperature (0.05) might be too aggressive\n   - Should be rebalanced to be less punishing\n\n4. Task performance:\n   - Episode lengths vary greatly (15-500)\n   - Many episodes end early (min 15.14)\n   - Need stronger incentive for survival\n\nImproved Reward Function:\n```python\n@torch.jit.script\ndef compute_reward(\n    dof_pos: torch.Tensor,\n    dof_vel: torch.Tensor\n) -> Tuple[torch.Tensor, Dict[str, torch.Tensor]]:\n    # Temperature parameters for reward components\n    angle_temp: float = 0.5  # Increased sensitivity to angle\n    position_temp: float = 0.15  # Slightly increased sensitivity\n    velocity_temp: float = 0.02  # Reduced penalty strength\n    survival_bonus: float = 0.1  # New component\n    \n    # Extract states\n    cart_pos = dof_pos[:, 0]\n    pole_angle = dof_pos[:, 1]\n    cart_vel = dof_vel[:, 0]\n    pole_vel = dof_vel[:, 1]\n    \n    # Angle reward - more sensitive to deviations\n    angle_reward = torch.exp(-angle_temp * torch.abs(pole_angle))\n    \n    # Position reward - slightly more sensitive\n    position_reward = torch.exp(-position_temp * (cart_pos ** 2))\n    \n    # Velocity penalty - less aggressive\n    velocity_penalty = torch.exp(-velocity_temp * (cart_vel ** 2 + 0.5 * pole_vel ** 2))\n    \n    # Survival bonus - encourages longer episodes\n    survival_reward = torch.ones_like(cart_pos) * survival_bonus\n    \n    # Combine components (multiplicative for main requirements, additive for survival)\n    total_reward = angle_reward * position_reward * velocity_penalty + survival_reward\n    \n    # Store individual components\n    reward_dict = {\n        \"angle_reward\": angle_reward,\n        \"position_reward\": position_reward,\n        \"velocity_penalty\": velocity_penalty,\n        \"survival_bonus\": survival_reward\n    }\n    \n    return total_reward, reward_dict\n```\n\nKey Improvements:\n1. Increased angle_temp (0.2 \u2192 0.5) to be more sensitive to small angle deviations\n2. Slightly increased position_temp (0.1 \u2192 0.15) for better centering\n3. Reduced velocity_temp (0.05 \u2192 0.02) and made pole velocity less penalized\n4. Added survival_bonus (0.1 per timestep) to encourage longer episodes\n5. Changed angle reward to use absolute value for more linear response\n6. Made total reward partially additive to ensure some reward even during learning\n\nThis should:\n- Maintain the good angle control we see in current results\n- Improve cart position stability\n- Reduce over-penalization of velocities\n- Strongly incentivize keeping the episode going\n- Provide more consistent learning signals throughout training"

Some helpful tips for analyzing the policy feedback:\n    (1) If the success rates are always near zero, then you must rewrite the entire reward function\n    (2) If the values for a certain reward component are near identical throughout, then this means RL is not able to optimize this component as it is written. You may consider\n        (a) Changing its scale or the value of its temperature parameter\n        (b) Re-writing the reward component \n        (c) Discarding the reward component\n    (3) If some reward components' magnitude is significantly larger, then you must re-scale its value to a proper range\nPlease analyze each existing reward component in the suggested manner above first, and then write the reward function code. The output of the reward function should consist of two items:\n    (1) the total reward,\n    (2) a dictionary of each individual reward component.\nThe code output should be formatted as a python code string: \"```python ... ```\".\n\nSome helpful tips for writing the reward function code:\n    (1) You may find it helpful to normalize the reward to a fixed range by applying transformations like torch.exp to the overall reward or its components\n    (2) If you choose to transform a reward component, then you must also introduce a temperature parameter inside the transformation function; this parameter must be a named variable in the reward function and it must not be an input variable.
